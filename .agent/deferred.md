# Deferred

Off-spine queue. One row = one improvement + the acceptance check that closes it, written at
deferral time while the evidence is fresh; a row leaves only when that check passes on a commit.
Read on demand — not attached state. A row promoted to an unfinished unit moves to `.agent/spec.md`
`Deferred`, which carries the spine, and returns here when the spine moves past it.

Evidence → `.agent/archive/{polish,review-m2}.md`; regen → `.claude/rules/gates.md`. Read the
rows before sizing any unit that touches their surfaces.

- **`isotropy_angle_fidelity_results.json` pins sample ids alone** (T2 R23) → binds script,
  validated-registry generation, run-tree + config digests.
- **Cohort census omits the external descriptor digest** (T4 R37) → census records it;
  `descriptor_collision` re-checkable.
- **Two census digests skip their own provenance block** (T5 R17, `sessions.py:588`,
  `measure/__init__.py:281`) → each covers its block minus its self-referential key.
- **`inventory_mutation_results.json` + `measure_mutation_results.json` target moved bytes** (2/2,
  2/3) → each campaign runs from clean checkout, no target-mismatch refusal, reproduces its kill
  list, and exits 1 on a seeded survivor with `M028` the sole allowlisted equivalent — today
  `run_inventory_mutations.py` returns 0 whatever survives (their only firing → `gates.md`).
- **Six legacy R clinical consumers re-implement suffix/read/bind** → one mode-aware reader; a
  mixed 2D+3D tree yields named mode outputs or rejection, 2D goldens unchanged.
- **`make_templates.R` + `validate_metadata.R` skip `_3d` silently** → both route through that
  reader; 2D templates + validation unchanged.
- **Four `../rehab` JP faces miss 14 cohort-label characters** → each reports 0 missing code points
  over the `cohort.FEATURES` `ja` union.
- **Gate prefix recalled by failure** → `scripts/gate.sh pytest -q` collects in primary tree + fresh
  worktree, bare `uv run pytest` still reproduces `GLIBC_2.43`, 0 bare invocations in `.agent/spec.md`
  + `.claude/rules/` + `docs/` + `scripts/` (`.agent/archive/` frozen, keeps its bare forms).
- **12/12 `check_*.py` ship green-only; `run_measure_mutations.py` firing unrecorded** (census +
  acceptance → `gates.md`) → each checker grows a committed seed driving it to its own named
  failure; a runner reports 12/12 refused, rc=1 naming one that stops. Covers the
  `nc_m2u74.py` port: 9/9 from clean, `SEED-INERT` on an inert seed,
  `docs/prospective_capture.md` byte-identical.
- **`steq.py` + `fidelity.sh` port; 24 register flags on four human surfaces** → one committed
  scanner reports 0 `LONG`/`FILLER` over the `conventions.md` inventory, fails a seeded 30-word
  instruction, no specifier/flag/number delta.
- **M2.8.4's two corpus checks port** → `scripts/check_corpus_2d_integrity.py` rc=0 on
  `output/corpus-2d` (379/379 set-equal, 11 verdicts true, breach < 0.1 %), rc=1 named on 3 tampers.
- **`--det-device GPU` unqualified against real detections** (9.7 vs 213 ms → ~7.1 h toward ~1 h) →
  GPU + CPU agree on the detection set, every padded row rejected by value, pilot green; then flip.
- **Detector scores outside `[0,1]` accepted silently** → score-range guard fires on NPU, silent on
  CPU + GPU, under the synthetic zeros probe.
- **`pose-estimation-run --session-dir … --output-dir X` ignores `X`** → rtmlib session artifacts
  land under the requested root; MediaPipe unchanged.
- **`sessions.py` predicates pinned by tests alone** → a campaign mirroring
  `run_inventory_mutations.py` kills every mutant with >=1 committed test, replaying from clean.
- **Review UI theme control proven by a scratch script alone** (`.scratch/theme_qa.mjs` → regen path
  in `.claude/rules/gates.md`) → a committed check drives the cycle, the pre-paint rehydration and
  the `:has()` stage backdrop, 13/13 green, failing under the two recorded seeds.
